        is in the beer biz. Everything from distribution and importing to German training
        and brewery operations. A few years ago we had an opportunity that would allow
        us to open up our own brewery. We jumped on it.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe\\u2019re extremely
        excited about this project, and we think it shows in everything we do. This
        is just plain fun for us. The day it starts to feel like a job is the day
        when lightning shall strike us dead. Cause, hey, at the end of the day we're
        making beer. And beer is fun.\\r\\n\\r\\nJoin us, it should be a kick ass
